Study design/Data source
========================

The variables used in this data set are taken from the UCI HAR Dataset, downloaded at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.  
See features_info.txt in that file for complete details about the original variables (transformations listed below).

Data transformation
===================
The code provided performs the following data transformations.
1.  It combines the individual data sets into one data set (includes x & y data for train and test as well as subject and activity data).
2.  It subsets the complete data set to those columns that include "mean" or "std" in the name, minus those that contain meanFreq as those aren't true means.
3.  It then renames the headers to be more readable
	a. It replaces the starting t with an appended -time to those variables starting with t to make it easier to understand what "t" stands for.
	b. It replaces the starting f with an appended -freq to those variables starting with f to make it easier to understand what "f" stands for.
	d. It makes the names lower case
	e. It removes the () to improve readability and reduce data confusion
4.  It takes the mean of the remaining columns grouped by subject/activity

Code Book - Additional variables created by the data transformation (the others are covered in detail in features_info.txt)
===========================================================================================================================

Two additional variables were created in this process, not covered in features_info.txt
	a. subjects - this column indicates the id of the subject covered
	b. activity - this column indicates the name of the activity the subject was completing at the time the data was measured
